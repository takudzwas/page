            Over the last decades, Our farming has been driven by the objective to increase food production. The
            global market, in particular the availability of cheap inputs (mineral fertilisers, animal feed), has introduced
            the logic of economies of scale. The intensification of farming systems was associated with specialisation of 
            farms and regions, leading to a separation of livestock and cash crop production. This had drastic 
            environmental consequences: water pollution due to an excess of manure and slurries, soil degradation, 
            depletion of natural resources, loss of biodiversity and lower resilience to climate change. But us as region 1,
            we are endowered with blessings as we do mixed farming on the same piece of land than any other regions, looking at
            our sustainable climatic conditions.
